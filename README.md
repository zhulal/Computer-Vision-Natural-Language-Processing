## Case 1: Computer Vision - Image Classification (CIFAR-10)

### Problem Statement:
In this case, the task is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories. The goal is to build a model using a deep learning approach, particularly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to achieve high accuracy in classifying these images.

### Approach:
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers and fully connected layers.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Preprocessing**: Image normalization, data augmentation to improve model robustness.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Define the CNN model architecture.
3. Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
4. Train the model on the training dataset.
5. Evaluate the model on the test set.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Load and preprocess the IMDb dataset.
2. Tokenize the text data and pad the sequences.
3. Build and train the LSTM model for sentiment classification.
4. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on test data using accuracy and F1-score.
5. Fine-tune the model for better performance.

### Problem Statement:
This case focuses on the task of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the goal is to identify and classify named entities (such as person names, locations, organizations, etc.) in a given text.

### Approach:
- **Dataset**: CoNLL-2003 dataset or custom NER dataset.
- **Model**: Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for sequence tagging.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras.
